# Licence
The ensemblejs project is copyright Ryan Boucher. However, I want people to make games with it.

## Non-Profit Games
If you're not charging for your game or, you are not making money through an alternate means: DLC, in-game purchases, advertisting, etc, then you can use *ensemblejs* for free.

The licence covers games. It doesn't cover derivative works. This means you can't fork the libraries and make your own game framework. You *can* fork the libraries to build modifications required for your game. I'd like it if you offered your derivative work for inclusion back into *ensemblejs* but this is not required.

I intend to keep this licence level available for all future releases.

## Commericial Games
I licence the *ensemblejs* libraries on a per-version basis. At present they are free for commercial use and will be for the next few releases.

- *ensemblejs* 3.x: as per non-profit games
- *ensemblejs* 2.x: as per non-profit games
- *ensemblejs* 1.x: as per non-profit games
- *ensemblejs* 0.x: as per non-profit games
- *ensemblejs-client* 1.x: as per non-profit games
- *ensemblejs-client* 0.x: as per non-profit games

My goal is to make this a commercial venture at some point. I don't know what that means at this point. If this licence is stopping you from using *ensemblejs* get in contact and we can work something out.
