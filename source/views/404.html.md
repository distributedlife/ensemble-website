# 404: Spilt milk; cry.
You're here because what you are looking for no longer exists. We're continuing to work on ensemble and with each new release comes decisions on whether to support older releases.

We try to support a version for as long as we can but, you know, here we are.

## If you insist
If you must find that **old** page then you can try the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/ensemblejs.com).

## Or, you can leap forward into the present
Here is how you can see if you have an outdated package.

~~~shell
npm outdated
~~~

And you'll get output in a similar arrangement to below.

~~~shell
Package          Current  Wanted  Latest  Location
ensemblejs         3.0.0   3.1.0   4.0.0  ensemblejs-demo-pixijs
~~~

Now you can update.

- Commit or stash what you are working on.
- Make a branch for the upgrade. I don't know how far behind you are but a major version `x.0.0` is backwards incompatible to some degree.

~~~shell
git checkout -b to_the_future_present
~~~

3. Update the version. Use the latest column from the `npm outdated` command.

~~~shell
npm install ensemblejs@4.0.0 -S
~~~

4. Review the [changelog and the upgrade steps](/docs/api/ensemblejs/latest/!Changelog.html).

## We're human too.
