# $
`Client`

This is the included implementation of Zepto/jQuery to use with *ensemblejs*. It is `zepto-browserify` with a single modification.

## id

A short cut to getting a node by the id. If an array is included the elements are joined using an underscore.

~~~javascript
$().id('my-key');               //returns zepto('#my-key')
$().id(['one', 'two', 'three']) //returns zepto('#one_two_three')
~~~
