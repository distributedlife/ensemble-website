# Time
`Client` `Server`

The time plugin gives you high precision time since an arbitrary point-in-time in the past. On the server it's likely to be the time since that instance started. On the client it's the time since the browser page started.

The time represents real world elapsed time. It continues to increase when the game is paused.

This time cannot be mapped onto a calendar.
