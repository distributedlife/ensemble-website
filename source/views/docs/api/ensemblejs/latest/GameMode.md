# GameMode `Client`

It's possible for an *ensemblejs* game to have more than one game mode. When the client connects it needs to specify the mode. This will match the client value to the server value. The default value is `game`. See the [restricted execution](/docs/guides/restricted-execution.html) guide for more information on how to use modes.
